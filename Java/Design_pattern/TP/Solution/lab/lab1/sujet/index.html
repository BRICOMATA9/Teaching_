Object-Oriented Principles</span><br>
<br>
1.&nbsp; A class should support one fundamental responsibiliity - don't
create classes that do too much as they are difficult to use and
maintain.
<br>
<br>
Suppose you wanted to design a system to play baseball. Instead of
creating
a class called <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">BatBall</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">,</span></big> create separate <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">Bat</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"> </span></big>and <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">Ball</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"> </span></big>classes. (In baseball,
a bat and a ball have different responsibilities.)<br>
<br>
2. Program to Interfaces Whenever Possible.<br>
<br>
3. Prefer Composition Over Inheritance.<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;" size="2" width="15%"><span

Program to Interfaces</span><br>
<br>
Consider the <a target="_blank"
 href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/List.html">java.util.List</a>
interface.<br>
<br>
By programming to interfaces, we are saying&nbsp; that we want to
encapsulate the operations of a particular data type (in this instance,
a List) into an
interface. Different implementations of this interface may design it
however they wish. By programming to an interface, we are separating
the implementation of an interface to its behavior. A further benefit
of this is that the interface can decouple the relationship between two
different objects. By decoupling the relationship between objects, one
object can change its implementation and the other is not affected.<br>

Modify <a target="_blank" href="UseList.java">UseList.java</a> so
that
it now uses a different implementation of the <big><span

Working with a partner, describe the benefits of using the <a
 target="_blank"
 href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html">java.util.Iterator</a>
interface. It is probably easiest to explain using the <a
 href="UseList.java">UseList.java</a> program - consider using a data
structure
different to the List but that provides an iteration. Using an
iteration,
illustrate how the iterator decouples the relationship between the list
implementation
(or any other data structure) and the method for traversing through the
list.<br>

IV. Prefer Composition Over Inheritance</span><br>
<br>
Object-oriented technology favors re-use whenever possible. Assume we
wanted to create a stack, the <a target="_blank"
 href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Vector.html">java.util.Vector
</a>class provides much of this functionality. In fact, the Java API
uses inheritance to implement the <a target="_blank"
 href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html">java.util.Stack</a>.<br>
<br>
In object-oriented terminology, inheritance is known as the <b>IS-A</b>
principle.<br>
<br>
The problem with this is we can break the contract of a traditional
stack by allowing operations not associated with a stack - notably the
ability to
modify the stack from a position other than the stack top:<br>
<br>
- <a target="_blank" href="TestJavaUtilStack.java">TestJavaUtilStack.java</a><br>
<br>
An alternative approach is to implement a stack <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">using</span> a <big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">java.util.Vector</span></big>,

not
extending it. That is, we are saying the stack will be <i><b>composed</b></i>
of a <big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">java.util.Vector</span></big>.
By
using
composition in this manner, we are <i><b>delegating</b></i> the
responsibility of the stack operations to another class.<br>
<br>
- <a target="_blank" href="CompositionStack.java">CompositionStack.java</a><br>
<br>
Code that tests it:<br>
<br>
- <a target="_blank" href="TestCompositionStack.java">TestCompositionStack.java</a><br>
<br>
In object-oriented terminology, composition is known as the <b>HAS-A</b>
principle. This leads to the following observation: HAS-A can be better
than
IS-A.<br>
<br>
As we shall see, many design patterns use composition.<br>

<br>
Once we have covered the section on <a target="_blank"
 href="http://www.people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/ggagne/uml">UML</a>,

draw
the UML class diagrams for the program you have chosen. Include
any details you feel are necessary including generalizations, abstract
classes, interfaces, dependencies, associations, composition, and
aggregation. You do not have necessarily have to worry about including
attributes and operations; focus mostly on the relationship between the
different classes.<br>
<br>
Draw the UML diagrams on a piece of paper - it is not necessary to
design them using software. Once you have finished, give your diagrams
as well as source code to your partner and have them check it for
accuracy, missing information,
etc. If your source code is only available online, switch seats with
your
partner so they may view the code.<br>
